# vue-3-dc-heros

This is one of the projects from a Vue 3 tutorial, the content is provided by Bitfumes Youtube Channel. I improved the app adding more styling and UI concepts.

In this app you can:

1. add an item in the list
2. delete items
3. click in redirectable links on the footer

UI features:

- Gradient effect on shadows (it makes the card seems like is floating)
- Grayish background for whiter content
- Custom outline on input
- Inverted background color and text color on hover
- Custom swinging effect when adding a new item 
- Responsive screen for mobile devices

This repo is based in:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) (Vue 3)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

You can try this project in development mode
```
yarn serve
```

You can also compile and minify it for production
```
yarn build
```

*PS.: This project has no backend server, so it deletes the new items when reloading the page.*
